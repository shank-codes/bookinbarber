----------Introduction----------

As we all know time is the most important thing in everyoneâ€™s life and in this digital world where everything is getting digitalized, we created a Web Application to book slots in barber shops.
Our Web Application will allow existing user to login or create a new account for non-existing user. Later he can book a slot in selected city and selected barber shop in that.
Barber shop owners can approach us to add their shop details in our Web Application, So that users will be able book slots in their shop and avoid waiting in queue for service in their shop.
Shop owners can view the details of users who booked a slot in their shop and also can delete the booked details of users whose service is completed.
